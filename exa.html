          <h3>New Telescope?</h3>
          <p class="text2">
            I think so i will have not a new telescope a long time because of my countries economy. I am still using my 50mm telescope and i am happy. This is enough for at the moment. But sure, i am going to buy new telescope in future. (Might in universty ^^)
